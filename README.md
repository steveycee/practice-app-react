# Getting Started 🌟

This app is a work in progress.

The aim of this repo is to provide people in QA (like me) with a simple React App to experiment with.

Clone this repo and use the simple application contained within to practice things like test automation and setting up CI/CD pipelines.

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) in order to make this app. It represents a step in my learning journey as well and felt that it would be helpful to share what I'd created to help others hit the ground running.

## Turning On/Running the App 👩‍💻

Open up this folder in your editor of choice (I use VSCode) and open a new terminal, you can run the following to get the application running in a browser in your local machine

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

The above script and others can be found in the `package.json` in the root directory of this project.

## Notes 📗

The original readme for create react app is available [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md) if you're curious about what the other scripts and dependencies do.
